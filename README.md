# Jin
Jin is a secure and automated refund system.

## How it works
1. After buyers make a payment, the funds are securely held in escrow by a smart contract.
2. Buyers can receive a refund during the guarantee period agreed upon by both the buyer and seller.
3. The seller can collect the payment after the refund period ends.
4. The entire process is managed by smart contracts, eliminating the need for third-party involvement.
